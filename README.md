4. Once the installation is complete, you can import and use Discord.TS in your Bun code.

## Getting Started
Here's a basic example to help you get started with Discord.TS:

```typescript
import { Client } from 'discord.ts';

// Create a new client instance
const client = new Client();

// Event listener for when the bot is ready
client.on('ready', () => {
  console.log(`Bot is ready!`);
});

// Event listener for incoming messages
client.on('messageCreate', (message) => {
  if (message.content === '!ping') {
    message.reply('Pong!');
  }
});

// Log in to the Discord API
client.login('YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN');
```

Make sure to replace `'YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN'` with your actual Discord bot token.
